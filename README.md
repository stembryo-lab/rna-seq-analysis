# Bulk RNA-Seq Analysis with STAR and pyDESeq2
Step-by-step pipeline of gastruloids transcriptomic sequencing data from [Mart√≠nez Arias Lab](https://amapress.upf.edu/]).

These scripts describe the quality control and alignment with [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) of the sequencing files of bulk RNA-Seq, as well as the downsteam differential expression analysis (DEA) with [pyDESeq2](https://pydeseq2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) in a Python environment.

## Sequencing files QC and preprocessing: FastQC
