# Bulk RNA-Seq Analysis
Step-by-step pipeline of gastruloids transcriptomic sequencing data from [Mart√≠nez Arias Lab](https://amapress.upf.edu/]).

These scripts describe the processing, QC, aligning and analyzing of bulk RNA-Seq, from the raw sequencing files to the downstream differential expression analysis and plotting.

## Sequencing files QC and preprocessing: FastQC
